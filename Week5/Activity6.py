# ==========================================================
# üìå NOTES / DOCUMENTATION
#
# Access Modifiers in Python:
# ----------------------------
# 1. Public (no underscore):
#    - Example: name, get_grade()
#    - Accessible everywhere (inside class, subclasses, outside class).
#
# 2. Protected (single underscore _):
#    - Example: _age, _promote()
#    - Accessible in class and subclasses.
#    - Can still be accessed outside, but discouraged by convention.
#
# 3. Private (double underscore __):
#    - Example: __grade, __demote()
#    - Accessible ONLY inside the class.
#    - Not accessible directly in subclasses or outside.
#    - Python uses "name mangling" ‚Üí stored as _ClassName__variable.
#
# Example Behavior:
# -----------------
# s = Student("Ali", 20)
# print(s.name)        # ‚úÖ Works (public)
# print(s._age)        # ‚ö†Ô∏è Works but discouraged (protected)
# print(s.get_grade()) # ‚úÖ Correct way to access private
# print(s.__grade)     # ‚ùå AttributeError (private)
#
# g = GraduateStudent("Sara", 25, "AI in Healthcare")
# print(g.display_info()) # ‚úÖ Works
# print(g.promote())      # ‚úÖ Works (calls protected method from parent)
# print(g.__demote())     # ‚ùå AttributeError (private)
