1.Figure out any problem that cannot be solved on classical computers
One big problem that classical computers can’t handle well is breaking really large numbers into their factors (for example, figuring out what two huge prime numbers multiply together to make a giant number). For small numbers this is easy, but when the numbers get extremely large—like the ones used in online banking security—it would take a classical computer millions of years. A quantum computer, however, can solve this much faster using something called Shor’s algorithm, which is why people say quantum computers could one day break today’s encryption.

Another example is simulating nature at the atomic level. Classical computers can only go so far when trying to model molecules or chemical reactions, because the amount of data needed grows too fast. Quantum computers, on the other hand, naturally work the way atoms and molecules do, so they can model these systems more efficiently. This could lead to new medicines or materials that classical computers could never realistically discover.

2.Technologies for generating qubits
-Superconducting qubits – Made from superconducting circuits cooled near absolute zero. They use Josephson junctions to create and control quantum states. (Used by IBM, Google.)

-Trapped ions – Individual ions are trapped using electromagnetic fields and manipulated with lasers. They are very stable and accurate but harder to scale. (Used by IonQ.)

-Quantum dots – Tiny semiconductor particles that can trap single electrons, with quantum states controlled by electrical signals. They resemble artificial atoms.

-Neutral atoms – Atoms with no charge, arranged in optical lattices and controlled by lasers. They offer scalability since large arrays can be formed.

-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) – Uses magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to control nuclear spins in molecules. Good for proof-of-concept systems but not easily scalable.
