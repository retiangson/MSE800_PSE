• Bloch Sphere Visualization Tasks
    ◦ Visualize and Draw Vectors in Cartesian Coordinates:
        ▪ Visualize where a vector at (1, 0, 0) would be on the Bloch sphere.

        ▪ Then, use a script to draw this vector.
        ▪ Visualize and draw a vector that is "behind me" (implied negative x-axis).
        ▪ Visualize and plot a vector that is "down and slightly towards my right" (implied negative Z and negative Y axis) using the script by tweaking its values.
    ◦ Experiment with Spherical Coordinates for Bloch Sphere:
        ▪ You need to represent vectors using the spherical coordinate system, which requires length, polar angle, and azimuthal angle as arguments.
        ▪ Draw vectors that align on the positive X-axis, positive Y-axis, negative Y-axis, negative X-axis, and negative Z-axis.
        ▪ For a vector aligning on the positive X-axis, the polar angle will be 90 degrees (π/2) and the azimuthal angle will be 0.
        ▪ For a vector aligning on the negative Y-axis, the polar angle will be 90 degrees (π/2) and the azimuthal angle will be 270 degrees (3π/2).
        ▪ For a vector aligning on the negative X-axis, the polar angle will be 90 degrees (π/2) and the azimuthal angle will be 180 degrees (π).
        ▪ You are instructed to download and execute the script, manipulating these angles to project the fundamental vector alignments.
• State Vector Calculation Tasks
    ◦ Calculate the State Vector for a Given Circuit (Task 1): Calculate the state vector for a circuit that begins with two qubits (0, 0) and applies a Hadamard gate (H) on the first qubit and an X gate on the second qubit.
    ◦ Home Assignment: Circuit Design and State Vector Verification (Task 2):
        ▪ For a circuit with a Hadamard gate, an X gate, and another X gate, where the initial states are 0, 1, and 1 respectively, calculate its state vector.
        ▪ Then, using the provided script, design this circuit by tweaking the existing script and verify if the state vector you computed matches what the system gives you.
• Unitary Matrix Task
    ◦ Identify and Test Unitary Matrices for Gates: For the quantum gates you are familiar with (Hadamard and X gates), figure out their unitary matrices.
    ◦ Multiply each matrix twice (A × A) and check if the result is an identity matrix. This demonstrates that these gates are represented by unitary matrices that are self-inverse.
